                of help <br>In 2011 she created a Facebook page, under the name (Iraqi Women Institution), dedicated to sharing different ideas and thoughts that could affect ociety positively. In 2012 the name was changed to (Iraqi Women Rights) that
                positioned itself solely to talking about women rights in Iraq. In 2014, Tamara started posting on Facebook on a daily basis to bring attention to the crisis that a lot of women are suffering injustice at the hands of the government, spouses
                or even family members. Her colleague Thuraya Rifat joined her as an admin on the page shortly after. Both were very active in posting different social problems to raise awareness about human and women’s rights in the community. They were
                also offering advice to women living under violence and bad conditions.</p>
